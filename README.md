# sdhelper

My own personal utility library to play around with GenAI models for image generation.

Designed to be used with jupyter notbooks.

Workflow based on explore / exploit /combine mechanisms, to iterate over multiple generations of images.

See the `diffusers.ipynb` notebook for some examples of use.
